# Thrive
a goofy little project I worked on over the summer to encapsulate philosophy, code, and games

Next Steps:
- [ ] Begin to encapsulate the pieces of the project more neatly so that there are separate files for separate needs
~- [ ] Implement new 'pew-pew' feature~
- [ ] Consider multiplayer options
