# Thrive
a goofy little project I worked on over the summer to encapsulate philosophy, code, and games

Next Steps:
- [ ] Begin to encapsulate the pieces of the project more neatly so that there are separate files for separate needs
- [ ] ~Implement new 'pew-pew' feature~ skipped!
- [ ] Consider multiplayer options
- [ ] Make some of the structures mutable so that we save computation in terms of not having to re-create entities
